# 0x02. ES6 Classes

## Overview

This project is part of the ALX Software Engineering Program. It's designed to help me understand and implement the fundamentals of ES6 classes. By the end of this project, I should be able to explain various concepts related to classes without needing to look them up.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, I aim to understand:

- How to define a Class
- How to add methods to a class
- Why and how to add a static method to a class
- How to extend a class from another
- Metaprogramming and symbols

## Requirements

### General

- All files will be executed on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using NodeJS 12.11.x
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`, `Visual Studio Code`
- All files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file is mandatory
- Code should use the `.js` extension
- Code will be tested using Jest and the command `npm run test`
- Code will be verified against lint using ESLint
- Code needs to pass all the tests and lint. You can verify the entire project running `npm run full-test`

## Key ES6 Classes Concepts

### Defining a Class

A class in ES6 is defined using the `class` keyword. It serves as a blueprint for creating objects with shared properties and methods.

### Adding Methods to a Class

Methods can be added to a class within its body. These methods are shared by all instances of the class.

### Static Methods

Static methods are defined using the `static` keyword and are called on the class itself, not on instances of the class.

### Extending a Class

A class can be extended from another class using the `extends` keyword. This allows the child class to inherit properties and methods from the parent class.

### Metaprogramming and Symbols

Metaprogramming involves writing code that can manipulate other code at runtime. ES6 introduced symbols, which are unique and immutable data types, primarily used as keys for object properties to avoid name collisions.

## Tasks

This project has various tasks to practice and implement the above concepts. Each task will help reinforce the learning objectives and build a strong foundation in ES6 classes.
